Do you have a webserver but hate the IP Address you have to type in? This article explains how to use a hostname instead of a IP Address.
The hostname for your webserver you already have and you can use it. The hostname for your webserver is your computer name. To see what your computer name is:
  - Click Start
  - Settings
  - Control Panel
  - System
  - (ON WIN XP) Click the tab Computer Name
  - You will see a line that says "Full Computer Name: -Computer Name-" That is your hostname.
That is the name that can be used instead of your ip address. To change your Computer Name (IN WIN XP)
  - Click Change... Button in the computer name tab in System.
  - The text box at the top is where you can change your computer name(HOSTNAME).
You will notice that when you try your hostname you cant use a suffix like (.com) (.org) (.net). Thats because you didnt set the suffix for your computer name.
  In (Change... Button) window you will see you have the textbox and another button that says (More...) click it. In that window you see there is a text box at the top with a label above it that says (Primary DNS suffix of this computer:). That is where you put the (com)(org)(net). Leave out the "." though.
  Thats about it. Hope this helps alot of you out there.
